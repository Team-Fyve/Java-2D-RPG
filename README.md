# Java 2D RPG

#### **Author(s):** Jason Whiting and Joshua Allen. 
##### Code inspired by CodeNMore's "NEW Beginner 2D Game Programming" YouTube series.

This game is a tile-based, top-down RPG similar to the Pokemon series. The majority of code
was written as I followed CodeNMore's YouTube series, with slight personal changes made along
the way. The game's future narrative (names of characters and locations, events, and plot)
will be origin work written by myself and Joshua Allen. The majority of the game's custom
tiles and sprites will also be created by Joshua Allen.

This game is still in its infancy as neither of us have enough experience with game-oriented
programming to compeltely finish it at this time. We hope to periodically return to this game
as we gain more knowledge and skill in programming.
